## Portfolio overview

This portfolio showcases three key projects developed during my first year as a front-end developer student at Noroff University. The projects are displayed as interactive cards, each providing a comprehensive look at the individual project. Every card includes:

- Project Title: The name of the project.
- Description: A brief overview of the project's purpose and key features.
- Screenshot: A visual preview of how the project looks when running.
- Links: Direct links to the project's GitHub repository and live site, where available.
  The projects featured in this portfolio are:

1. Semester Project 2
   A more complex project that demonstrates advanced front-end development skills, utilizing responsive design and dynamic components.

2. JavaScript Frameworks CA
   A project focused on the use of JavaScript frameworks to build interactive user interfaces, exploring libraries such as React.js.

3. Project Exam 2
   A comprehensive final project that highlights my ability to manage larger codebases, implement best practices, and solve real-world problems.

Each project is documented thoroughly with a README.md file in the root of the repository, detailing setup instructions, technologies used, and configuration for running the code smoothly. This ensures other developers can easily review and understand each project.

Additionally, this portfolio demonstrates my ability to document and present projects in a professional manner, showcasing both technical skills and attention to detail.
